# MOKA: Moral Knowledge Augmentation for Moral Event Extraction

## Introduction
This repository contains codes and dataset for paper ["MOKA: Moral Knowledge Augmentation for Moral Event Extraction"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09733.pdf) (NAACL 2024).

**Update**
- [04/09/2024] We released the initial version of MORALITY BANK (Good for model pre-training to inject moral knowledge derived from moral words ðŸš€).
- [03/13/2024] Our MOKA paper is accepted to NAACL 2024 Main Conference ðŸŒŸ!
- [01/18/2024] We released the initial version of MoralEvents (Good for downstream moral reasoning capability assessment ðŸš€).
- [11/15/2023] We released the arXiv version of our [MOKA paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09733.pdf).
